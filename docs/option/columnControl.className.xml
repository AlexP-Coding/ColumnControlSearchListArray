		When working with ColumnControl over multiple rows, you may find that you wish to style cells in the table's header / footer, a little differently from the default, based on the content that you want to put into the rows. A typical example is the `-tag input` for a column search should typically be reasonably close to the title text, and you might not wish to have a border separating them.

		This configuration option makes that sort of styling possible by adding class names to the `-tag tr` for the ColumnControl target row (`-init columnControl.target`).

		ColumnControl's CSS has two built in styles for this use case:

		* `dtcc-row_no-bottom-border` - No border at the bottom of the row's cells
		* `dtcc-row_no-top-padding` - no padding at the top of the row's cells.

		The class name string that is assigned is freeform - you can add your own class names and styles in CSS as required for your table's look and feel.
