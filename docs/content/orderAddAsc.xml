	<description>
		DataTables has the ability to order the table's data over multiple columns, which is particularly useful if the data in the primary column being ordered has a large amount of repetition - the second column in the order will take over the order sequence.

		This button, along with similar content type buttons, provides the ability to access this multi-column ordering. In this case when the button is triggered it will add the host column to the already set ordering for the DataTable, ascending direction.

		### Display

		The button added by this control will display as a simple icon button at the top level, or as a button with icon and text in a dropdown. It is generally expected that it will be used in a dropdown to avoid cluttering the UI.

	<option type="string" name="icon" default="orderAddAsc">
		Button icon. Can take the name of any icon available in `DataTable.ColumnControl.icons` (which is a writeable object containing SVG icons).
	</option>

	<option type="string" name="text" default="Add Sort Ascending">
		Trigger button text (shown when in a dropdown). Can also be set by the `orderAddAsc` key of `-init language.columnControl`, which will take priority if set.
	</option>
