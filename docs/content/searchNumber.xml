	<description>
		This content type adds numeric search to a ColumnControl content list through a `-tag input` element which accepts number input. The list of logic options for how the search should perform its tests are also suitable for number based data.

		The `-tag input` element has the following attributes set in order to help present input options for numeric input (particular on mobile devices):

		* `inputmode="numeric"`
		* `pattern="[0-9]*"`

		It should be noted that `-content search` should generally be used rather than this one directly, as `-content search` will select the most appropriate search input based on the column type.

		### Display

		It is expected that this content type will have a full cell to draw in if used at the top level, as the it benefits from having a large amount of space available (i.e. other buttons won't be used along with it at the top level for a specific set of cells).

		In a dropdown this content type will display as part of the regular content list.

	<option type="boolean" name="clear" default="true">
		Indicate if a clear icon should be shown at the end of the search `-tag input` element. When enabled a cross icon will be shown when the input has a value and clicking on the icon will clear the search.
	</option>

	<option type="string" name="placeholder" default="">
		Value to set the `placeholder` attribute of the `-tag input` element to.
	</option>

	<option type="string" name="title" default="">
		Text shown above the input, which can be used to tell the end user information about what the search will do. The given string will have the substring `[title]` will be replaced with the column title.
	</option>

	<option type="string" name="titleAttr" default="">
		Value to set the `title` attribute of the search `-tag input` element which can be used to help with accessability. The given string will have the substring `[title]` will be replaced with the column title.
	</option>
