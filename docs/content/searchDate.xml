	<description>
		This content type adds a search input suitable for use with date-based columns. An `-tag input` element is added to the ColumnControl content list, and the list of logic options for how the search should perform its tests are also suitable for date-based data.

		If the [DataTables DateTime picker library](https://datatables.net/extensions/datetime/) is available on your page, focusing on the `-tag input` will cause a date picker to appear.

		The format of the date input will match the format used in the column if [using the builder in `datetime` rendering function](https://datatables.net/manual/data/renderers#Date-and-time-helpers).

		It should be noted that `-content search` should generally be used rather than this one directly, as `-content search` will select the most appropriate search input based on the column type.

		Examples showing the use of this content type [are available on the DataTables website](https://datatables.net/extensions/columncontrol/examples/searchDates/).

		### Display

		It is expected that this content type will have a full cell to draw in if used at the top level, as it benefits from having a large amount of space available (i.e. other buttons won't be used along with it at the top level for a specific set of cells).

		In a dropdown, this content type will display as part of the regular content list.

	<option type="boolean" name="clear" default="true">
		Indicate if a clear icon should be shown at the end of the search `-tag input` element. When enabled a cross icon will be shown when the input has a value and clicking on the icon will clear the search.
	</option>

	<option type="string" name="placeholder" default="">
		Value to set the `placeholder` attribute of the `-tag input` element to.
	</option>

	<option type="string" name="title" default="">
		Text shown above the input, which can be used to tell the end user information about what the search will do. The given string will have the substring `[title]` will be replaced with the column title.
	</option>

	<option type="string" name="titleAttr" default="">
		Value to set the `title` attribute of the search `-tag input` element which can be used to help with accessability. The given string will have the substring `[title]` will be replaced with the column title.
	</option>
