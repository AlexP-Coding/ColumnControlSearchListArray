<title lib="ColumnControl">Dropdowns: Nesting</title>

<info><![CDATA[

The previous example showed a simple dropdown, but in keeping with keeping the UI manageable, you might wish to present a lot of options, and thus show some in a nested dropdown (most users will be familiar with this paradigm from their computer's operating system).

A nested dropdown can be defined by simply using an array inside the dropdown array, however, for nested content you will likely wish to provide the user information about what is in the dropdown. To do this, recall that a dropdown is provided by `-content dropdown` and we can set individual properties for a content type by providing it as an object. In this case we set `text` and the `content` properties for `-content dropdown`.

This example demonstrates the use of `-content colVis` in the nested dropdown. This content type shows a list that the end user to use to select which columns are visible in the table. As you might imagine, it is relatively common to do this, so ColumnControl has a `-content colVisDropdown` type built in which sets the text and icon automatically. The dropdown object from this example could be replaced by it, but the object of this example is to demonstrate how to define any content in a nested dropdown!
