<title lib="ColumnControl">Multiple rows</title>

<info><![CDATA[

The [previous example](./targets.html) shows the use of `-init columnControl` as an object to insert content into a specific row in the header. We've also [seen this option](./singleButton.html) being used as a shorthand to insert content to the default row. There is a third and final form `-init columnControl` can take which allows ColumnControl content types on multiple rows.

This example shows `-init columnControl` with an array of ColumnControl configuration objects (i.e. objects with with `target` and `content` properties), each with its own target. In this case the first row in the header has the `-content order` button added, and the second has `-content search` inserted. You can have as many entries as you need in this array.

Next: [Footer target](./footer.html).
